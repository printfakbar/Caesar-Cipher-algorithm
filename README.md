# 🌼 Iris Flower Classification 

In this project, we build a simple Machine Learning model to classify *iris flowers* into three species:

- Setosa  
- Versicolor  
- Virginica  

Classification is done based on *sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width*. The dataset used is the classic Iris dataset.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Google Colab**
- **Libraries:**
  - pandas, numpy – for data manipulation
  - matplotlib, seaborn – for data visualization
  - scikit-learn – for machine learning model building and evaluation

## 🚀 Project Workflow

1. **Load the Dataset**  
   - Used `sklearn.datasets.load_iris()` to import the Iris dataset.

2. **Explore and Visualize the Data**  
   - Analyzed feature distributions and relationships using statistical summaries and visual plots (pair plots, heatmaps).

3. **Preprocess the Data**  
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets (80-20 split).

4. **Train the Model**  
   - Trained a *K-Nearest Neighbors* or *Decision Tree Classifier* on the training data.

5. **Evaluate the Model**  
   - Assessed accuracy using classification metrics like:  
     - Accuracy Score  
     - Confusion Matrix  
     - Classification Report

6. **Visualize the Results (Optional)**  
   - Plotted confusion matrix using seaborn for visual clarity.
